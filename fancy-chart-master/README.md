# A Fancy Chart Control in JavaFX

## Introduction

This complex JavaFX control is a combination of a LineChart and a TableView control. It shows some advanced features of JavaFX in order to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of this new UI toolkit. The features include:

 * display of a line chart,
 * animations in the chart,
 * databinding between a chart and a table including immediate updates,
 * table cell editing,
 * and last, but not least, a visually appealing look and feel based on CSS styling and advanced layouts.
